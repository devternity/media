          h2 Knowledge
        mj-text(align="center" color="grey") 
          | We â€“ IT professionals, have to take a break from routine work to sharpen our skills. A dull axe won't cut a tree nearly as effectively as a sharp one. I read piles of books, watch videos, write code, speak, consult, but I always return from a good conference with new ideas and approaches that make me more efficient at work. Even though I can't apply all ideas, it doesn't mean the ideas are wasted. Work is temporary, 
          b career is lifelong

        mj-text(align="center" color="grey") 
          | A great conference is inspiring. Inspired people are way more productive. For creative workers, like you and me, running at 100% utilisation is counterproductive. 
          b DevTernity reloads your batteries 
          |  and gives inspiration for a battle. As famous saying goes â€“ slow down to hurry up.

DevTernity is a great opportunity to make new connections, hangout with speakers, and be part of fantastic, like-minded community. Networking is about planting relations.
